### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Samuel, a web developer from Berlin, Germany.

Here are some small projects I've worked on:

### [Certificate Generator](https://nimble-crepe-557937.netlify.app/)
- Simple JS app that lets the user type his/her name and generate a downloadable course certificate for him/her

### [Todo App (React)](https://delightful-cocada-b8dc0f.netlify.app/)
- Simple todo app written in React that allows you to add todos, mark them as complete, and delete them as you like.
